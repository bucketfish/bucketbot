# bucket bot!
hello :) welcome to the bucket bot repository!

## development
1. clone the code

2. you will need to install the following python modules:
  - disnake (disnake)
  - dotenv (python-dotenv)
  - pickle (pickle-mixin)
3. make your own discord bot to code on.
  - create a discord bot (go to discord.com/developers)
  - create a .env file
  - in the .env file, write the following
```DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE```
  - replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with the token of your discord bot

4. to test the slash commands faster, you can also uncomment the ```test_guilds=[]``` line in bot.py and paste the ID of your test server inside.

5. happy coding!
